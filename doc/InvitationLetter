We are looking for participants for a human-robot collaboration experiment. The purpose of this study is to analyze influence of emotion-regulated processes on collaborators' behaviors in collaborative tasks. The participant stands opposite a Youbot KUKA (stationary) robot and will be working on a shared task with available pegs on a table top board. The tasks involve picking up and placing the available pegs to achieve the overall goal, i.e., installing a solar panel with the robot. We will use commercially available cameras to record the participants movements. This study is part of an effort to understand human robot collaboration and the underlying cognitive processes.

We are looking for approximately 30 participants.  Participants will be paid $10 for their participation, which will take 45 minutes. There will be also a $100 Amazon gift card for the participant with the best collaborative behavior. The gift card will be sent to the winner the week after Monday 7/4.
